Alien::libvas - Perl distribution for libvas

=head1 INSTALL

    cpan Alien::libvas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<Proc::Memory> for a Perl wrapper that makes use of this distribution.

=head1 PLATFORMS

libvas claims compatiblity with WinAPI's ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMeory, macOS/GNU Hurd Mach API, Linux procfs /proc/pid/mem, ptrace (2), and process_vm_readv/process_vm_writev, SunOS/Solaris procfs /proc/pid/as and finally BSD with ptrace (2) or procfs.

I don't have all these systems to verify this. So please report bugs, preferably on Github. :-)
